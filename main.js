School of Code Grade

takes inputs of (projects, daily test)
project score - 90+
daily test completed- 40-48
return final grade - "A - You're getting hired"

project score - 80-89
daily test completed- 30-39
return final grade - "B - You're doing well"

project score - 60-79
daily test completed- 20-29
return final grade - "C - Come to code camp"

project score - Less than 60
daily test completed- Less than 20
return final grade - "F - Do your recap tasks again""

Create a function called SOCfinalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the project and a number of completed daily tests.

This function should take two arguments: project- grade for project (from 0 to 100); daily tests - number of completed tests (from 0 to 48);

This function should return a string (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

- If project score is over 90 and the number of daily tests completed is over 40, then give them the final grade "A - You're getting hired "

- If project score is between 80-89 and the number of daily tests completed is 30-39, then give them the final grade "B - You're doing well "

- If project score is between 60-79 and the number of daily tests completed is 20-29, then give them the final grade of "C - Come to code camp"

- If project score is less than 60 and the number of daily tests completed is less than 20, then give them the final grade "F - Do your recap tasks again"

Examples(Inputs-->Output):

100, 42 --> "A - You're getting hired "
65, 25 --> "C - Come to code camp"
